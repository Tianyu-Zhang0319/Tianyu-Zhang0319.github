I was born and raised in China. After graduating from South China University of Technology as a graduate student in 2019, I began to study for a doctorate at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. I am currently engaged in scientific research in [Regina Beets-Tan's](https://www.nki.nl/research/research-groups/regina-beets-tan/){:target="_blank"} group in the Radiology Department of the [Netherlands Cancer Institute](https://www.nki.nl/){:target="_blank"}, and [Ritse Mann's](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vPwW_6EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN){:target="_blank"} Breast Imaging Group (BIG) in [RadboudUMC](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/patient-care){:target="_blank"}. In early 2023, under the leadership of Ritse Mann, I participated in the ODELIA project as a postdoctoral researcher.


Research Interests
======
My research focuses on deep learning on breast imaging, and the development and evaluation of artificial intelligence for breast cancer diagnosis using multimodal data. My current projects include predicting molecular subtypes of breast cancer using multimodal data (mammography, ultrasound, MRI, etc.) based on deep learning, processing unstructured electronic health records and providing decision support based on natural language processing models, synthesis of missing MRI sequences based on AI models, prediction of breast cancer response to therapy based on radiomics, etc.
